	<b>Background:</b><br/>
	Aruba is, together with Bonaire and Curacao, known as one of the A-B-C Islands in the Caribbean. 
	The island has a long a history. Originally populated by the Caquetios Indians from the Arawak tribe, 
	the island was colonised by the Spanish, the Dutch, the English and later again by the Dutch. As of 
	1986 Aruba has an independent status within the Dutch Commonwealth. The population of Aruba is 
	about 100,000 consisting of over 40 nationalities. The unemployment rate is extremely low and as is 
	the number of families under the poverty level. There is very little violent crime on the island. 
	Tourism forms a large part of the economy and the islanders are normally very friendly and helpful.
	Communication is easy - English, Dutch, Spanish and Papiements (the local language) are spoken 
	nearly everywhere. Street signs, restaurant menu's, telephone books, etc are usually printed in both 
	Dutch and English. The majority of tourists come from the US, Venezuela and the Netherlands.
	The climate is exceptionally pleasant. The island lies close to the equator and is well placed away 
	from the hurricane zone. Storms rarely touch the Aruba. There are few rainy days and therefore that 
	many more sunny ones. Prevailing breezes make the temperature of 81° F very enjoyable all year 
	round!
