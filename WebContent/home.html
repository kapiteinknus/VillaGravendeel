	Our luxurious Ocean view villa with private pool and tropical garden is located on one of the best
	spots in Malmok area, Aruba's coveted residential neighbourhood and adjacent to beautiful Boca 
	Catalina, a favourite snorkeling and sunworshipper's beach. This is our vacation home and we'd love 
	to share our pride and joy with you!
</p>
<p>
	We took great care in ensuring that no details were overlooked in our newly rebuild home as we 
	wish for everything to work perfectly while you visit our home during your well-deserved vacation! 
	We hope you will appreciate it as much as we do. Aruba is a wonderful island and we feel even more 
	fortunate to be at Boca Catalina.

	We take pride in the fact that our villa is always clean, up-to-date and well-maintained. Our villa is 
	not just a rental property as most other properties are. Our villa throughout the year is very well 
	maintained to the highest standards. We provide additional services for our guests and adjust it to 
	meet the needs and schedules during your stay. We also provide regular pool and grounds 
	maintenance to make sure the outdoor areas are always as nice as the indoors.
</p>
<p>
	We hope to welcome you to the villa soon and that you will enjoy Villa Gravendeel and everything 
	this beautiful island has in store for you.
