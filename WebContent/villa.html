<p>	<b>Location</b><br/>
	The Arashi/Malmok area is the most exclusive area in Aruba and one of the safest. The area not only 
	has beautiful beaches, it is also the most famous snorkeling area in Aruba. The ocean is very shallow 
	for quite a ways offshore and you can see a huge number and variety of fish just next to the beach. 
	The water is usually very calm here, making it a perfect place for children and beginner snorkelers. 
	You can experience the best of both worlds in this location. Just down the road, literally a couple of 
	minutes drive to the south, is the highrise hotel area of Palm Beach, with a huge variety of 
	restaurants, shopping, spas, cinemas, and casinos. You can book any type of adventure or tour 
	imaginable here - skydiving, parasailing, horseback riding, ATV, scuba, sunset catamaran sails along 
	the coast, and much more.

	A few minutes to the north of the villa is the unspoiled wilderness of the lighthouse area. This area 
	has been left completely undeveloped and is a great place for strolls and to see the wild natural side 
	of Aruba. There is a well-maintained unpaved road running along the coast on the north point where 
	you can see blowholes, ancient Divi-Divi trees, sanddunes and piles of giant granite boulders along 
	the shore and large stands of cactus inland. A perfect place for photographers. 
	Truly, close to everything, while being "away from it all". Although we would recommend renting a 
	car to get around the island, there is a regular bus service between Arashi, the hotel area, and 
	downtown, which passes right by the house.
</p>
We would be glad to assist you during your holiday and can offer you our extra services.
